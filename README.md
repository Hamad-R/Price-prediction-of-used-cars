Machine Learning model to predict price of used car

Multiple linear regression will be the primary focus of this research. The term "multiple linear regression" refers to using more than one variable to predict the response variable. As a result, our primary objective here is to estimate the market value of your car. We'll use a statistical model to figure out the value of your car.
